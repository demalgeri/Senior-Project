Stock market prediction with classification

For my senior capstone project at CSU Channel Islands I did stock market prediction. 
Here is a link to my website that contains my poster and a video presentation: http://demalgeri.cikeys.com/28-2/

The following paragraphs are a summary of my project/ how to run the project:

In my research, I used ML classification techniques to predict whether the stock 
price would rise or fall on the next day for the two companies, Apple and Procter & 
Gamble. To do so, I employed various classifiers trained by different sets of features. 

I fed historical stock market data to the models and 
trained the models so that they could predict whether the price would rise or fall in 
the next day. In this research, I have used two types of models: classical ML models and 
neural network (NN) based models. The classical ML models were trained by 
handcrafted features calculated from the historical stock data and NN based models 
were trained by raw features from the historical stock data.

The question I pursued was about which of these scenarios produced a better 
prediction accuracy:

• Classical ML models trained with handcrafted features

• NN based models trained with raw features

• Classical ML models trained with both raw and handcrafted features

• NN based models trained with both raw and handcrafted features

Each of the .py files in this repository can be run seperately. 
They are each named according to the different scenarios listed above. 
However, there is only one file for the last two scenarios.
